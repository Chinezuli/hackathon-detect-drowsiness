# hackathon-detect-drowsiness


I worked on a raspberry pi 1gb ram board, with the help of a raspberry pi camera. Unfortunately, I only have photos, because I forgot to copy the project from the plate to the computer. So sad. I used a lot of python libraries, the machine already learned from github. Working time was 2 days.
